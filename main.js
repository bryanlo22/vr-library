Holo obviously was inspired by Holodeck, so imagine \u0026quot;dancing in the Holodeck\u0026quot;. Of course, \u0026quot;dancing\u0026quot; just means tuning into the rhythm and freely moving with the music. There's orbs arriving perfectly in sync with the music that you need to catch, and curves you need to follow. But no, we're not gonna tell you how to move because we consider dancing really a free expressive movement of rhythm and joy.\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a kind of serious story mode with music composed specifically for the game, which is still under heavy development - that's what our original store description was about, so you're kind of getting two games in one:\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eStory-Mode\u003c/h2\u003e\r\r\u003cbr\u003eStrap on your headset, grab your controllers, and experience Holodance. Designed from the ground up for the HTC Vive, Holodance is a 1-4 player \u003ci\u003ecollaborative multiplayer Virtual Reality rhythm game\u003c/i\u003e which places you center stage \u003ci\u003e(NOTE: Multiplayer is currently under heavy development and not functional)\u003c/i\u003e. Your body is your instrument as you find yourself entering and dancing through a series of room-scale VR music videos starring you, your friends, and dragons. Make new friends, learn their moves, take in their story and hear their warning. \u003ci\u003eEpisode 1: Dancing with Dragons\u003c/i\u003e features twelve songs, each with four perfectly timed partitions so the action precisely matches the music. The dragons traveled very far to find and bring you on a special journey through rhythm, melodies, time and space. They came here to find out one thing:\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eAre \u003cu\u003eyou\u003c/u\u003e ready to write a new history for the future?\u003c/i\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eAll music is composed and produced specifically for this VR experience using ear-tantalizing 3D audio spatialisation so you can hear each instrument in the space around you while catching those rhythmic orbs the dragons throw your way. Your best headphones are strongly recommended. We have both audio-data for each instrument track for perfect sound as well as MIDI-data for perfectly precise gameplay that's almost like you're actually there, playing the instrument as you dance. Miss a note, however, and the track you're playing becomes muted until you get back into the beat. Your friends will know who is missing notes. You will know which one of your friends is missing notes. Don't be too mean though, and they may return the favor. The dragons would prefer if you get along and cooperate as more pressing issues are at claw. I mean at hand. Sorry.\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eHow to Tune into the Music\u003c/h2\u003e\rHolodance is fully controlled with motion tracked controllers designed for room-scale VR. Be ready to catch notes with both of your hands. If it becomes too hectic, why not use your head too? The game features a variety of styles for catching notes: \u003ci\u003ePercussive instruments\u003c/i\u003e have notes in the form of orbs flying your way as you drum out the rhythm. \u003ci\u003eSustained instruments\u003c/i\u003e come as paths in 3D space which you glide your hands along in just the right pace. If that isn't enough and you seek to truly impress the dragons, there are stationary orbs that you can tap in any sequence - you will just need to match the rhythm and hit the orbs to the beat. At that point you may almost be considered a musician, unless being a musician is actually what got you this far. Then, be prepared for some twists and surprises in Levels 10, 11 and 12. Speaking of which:\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eBeautiful Environments\u003c/h2\u003e\r\u003ci\u003eHolodance Episode 1: Dancing with Dragons\u003c/i\u003e features 12 levels, each with unique music and environment. The VR aspect of the game pulls you directly into the environments; feel free to look around and enjoy the sights. The dragons first take you through nine levels on a journey over land, through the air, beneath the waves and across time. Afterwards, you will experience two very different levels in a potential dystopic future setting - a future you may want to change. (Please be aware that the later settings in Holodance may be frightening for children, parental discretion is strongly encouraged as the game is not intended for kids) In the final level, you might find out how to divert the path that history takes as you finally meet \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e ... the mythical one ... the Blue Mother of all dragons.\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eCollaborative Multiplayer\u003c/h2\u003e\rHolodance can be played alone but where it really shines is with three fellow dancers. Join up with your friends to tackle songs or meet strangers to impress and befriend. Everyone's score is added up; the more people you have in a session, the higher your maximum score, so you will shine most as band of four: Four instrument tracks, four heroes each with their own track; the leader boards are ready. Tackle it solo or with friends, competitive or casual; fun is the real achievement.

Stepmania support is coming very soon, and our own, native Holodance beatmap editor is coming soon (with this, you will be able to play any MP3 you have on your computer). So what you are getting here is a very solid Virtual Reality rhythm game that you can play with a fairly large library of high quality content.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Holodance? Holo obviously was inspired by Holodeck, so imagine \u0026quot;dancing in the Holodeck\u0026quot;. Of course, \u0026quot;dancing\u0026quot; just means tuning into the rhythm and freely moving with the music. There's orbs arriving perfectly in sync with the music that you need to catch, and curves you need to follow. But no, we're not gonna tell you how to move because we consider dancing really a free expressive movement of rhythm and joy.\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a kind of serious story mode with music composed specifically for the game, which is still under heavy development - that's what our original store description was about, so you're kind of getting two games in one:\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eStory-Mode\u003c/h2\u003e\r\r\u003cbr\u003eStrap on your headset, grab your controllers, and experience Holodance. Designed from the ground up for the HTC Vive, Holodance is a 1-4 player \u003ci\u003ecollaborative multiplayer Virtual Reality rhythm game\u003c/i\u003e which places you center stage \u003ci\u003e(NOTE: Multiplayer is currently under heavy development and not functional)\u003c/i\u003e. Your body is your instrument as you find yourself entering and dancing through a series of room-scale VR music videos starring you, your friends, and dragons. Make new friends, learn their moves, take in their story and hear their warning. \u003ci\u003eEpisode 1: Dancing with Dragons\u003c/i\u003e features twelve songs, each with four perfectly timed partitions so the action precisely matches the music. The dragons traveled very far to find and bring you on a special journey through rhythm, melodies, time and space. They came here to find out one thing:\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eAre \u003cu\u003eyou\u003c/u\u003e ready to write a new history for the future?\u003c/i\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eAll music is composed and produced specifically for this VR experience using ear-tantalizing 3D audio spatialisation so you can hear each instrument in the space around you while catching those rhythmic orbs the dragons throw your way. Your best headphones are strongly recommended. We have both audio-data for each instrument track for perfect sound as well as MIDI-data for perfectly precise gameplay that's almost like you're actually there, playing the instrument as you dance. Miss a note, however, and the track you're playing becomes muted until you get back into the beat. Your friends will know who is missing notes. You will know which one of your friends is missing notes. Don't be too mean though, and they may return the favor. The dragons would prefer if you get along and cooperate as more pressing issues are at claw. I mean at hand. Sorry.\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eHow to Tune into the Music\u003c/h2\u003e\rHolodance is fully controlled with motion tracked controllers designed for room-scale VR. Be ready to catch notes with both of your hands. If it becomes too hectic, why not use your head too? The game features a variety of styles for catching notes: \u003ci\u003ePercussive instruments\u003c/i\u003e have notes in the form of orbs flying your way as you drum out the rhythm. \u003ci\u003eSustained instruments\u003c/i\u003e come as paths in 3D space which you glide your hands along in just the right pace. If that isn't enough and you seek to truly impress the dragons, there are stationary orbs that you can tap in any sequence - you will just need to match the rhythm and hit the orbs to the beat. At that point you may almost be considered a musician, unless being a musician is actually what got you this far. Then, be prepared for some twists and surprises in Levels 10, 11 and 12. Speaking of which:\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eBeautiful Environments\u003c/h2\u003e\r\u003ci\u003eHolodance Episode 1: Dancing with Dragons\u003c/i\u003e features 12 levels, each with unique music and environment. The VR aspect of the game pulls you directly into the environments; feel free to look around and enjoy the sights. The dragons first take you through nine levels on a journey over land, through the air, beneath the waves and across time. Afterwards, you will experience two very different levels in a potential dystopic future setting - a future you may want to change. (Please be aware that the later settings in Holodance may be frightening for children, parental discretion is strongly encouraged as the game is not intended for kids) In the final level, you might find out how to divert the path that history takes as you finally meet \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e ... the mythical one ... the Blue Mother of all dragons.\u003ch2 class=\"bb_tag\"\u003eCollaborative Multiplayer\u003c/h2\u003e\rHolodance can be played alone but where it really shines is with three fellow dancers. Join up with your friends to tackle songs or meet strangers to impress and befriend. Everyone's score is added up; the more people you have in a session, the higher your maximum score, so you will shine most as band of four: Four instrument tracks, four heroes each with their own track; the leader boards are ready. Tackle it solo or with friends, competitive or casual; fun is the real achievement.
